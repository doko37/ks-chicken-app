- Displays active orders recieved from the website
- Connects to an EPSON epos printer to allow staff to print out order receipts to easily send orders to the kitchen
- Function for locking time slots when restaurant gets busy (e.g. lock 12:30AM from the application which then makes it unavailable for customers on the website to order for that particular time)
- Function for closing the store and disabling online ordering from the website.
